threads to manage odd and even requests, thus dividing the work.

 -Otherwise can use the command "cc -o assignment_2.out My_Alarm.c -D_POSIX_PTHREAD_SEMANTICS -lpthread -I."
 
To run: 

	-run "assignment_2.out"
	
To use:

At any time, it is possible to request a new alarm by entering the number of seconds desired followed by the message as a string.
